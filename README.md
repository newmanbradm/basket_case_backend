# Basket Case
> An arcade-style, catch-the-apples type game. Make sure to avoid the Beehives!!

Created with a Ruby on Rails API backend and a Javascript frontend, Basket Case is a game inspired by arcade type games. You must catch as many apples as you - it's okay if you miss some - and gain as many points as possible to be on the leaderboard; just make sure to avoid the Beehives! You start with 3 health packs, if a beehive touches you (the basket), then you will lose a life.

Javascript front end repo available here: https://github.com/Ms-Alex/basket-case-frontend
